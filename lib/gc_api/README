// GROUNDCREW VIEWER<->SERVER COMMUNICATIONS
//
// To communicate with the server, the viewer polls a file every 20s
// at http://[SERVER]/data/this10.js, which contains all events from 
// the last few minutes.  The server returns javascript which calls a 
// limited set of four functions: {item,event,city,idea}, defined in 
// models.js.  These functions, when called, add or update
// entries in an in-browser, in-memory database which is used to draw
// them map and fill out the UI.
